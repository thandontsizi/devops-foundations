# Networking Fundamentals:
Networking is how computers communicate with each other.
Instead of sending information in one large message, data is broken down into smaller pieces called packets. These packets are sent across a networkand are reassembled at the destination.

## Core Concepts:
### Network:
- A network is a group of connected devices that can exchange data.

### Packet:
- A packet is a small unit of data sent over a network.
- Each packet contains part of the message along with source and destination information.

### IP Address:
- An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- It allows other devices to know where to send packets.

### Router (Gateway):
- A router connects one netwrok to another and forwards packets to their destination.

### Protocol:
- A set of rules that define how data is transferred or transmitted and received between devices.
