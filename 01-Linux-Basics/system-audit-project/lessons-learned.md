## Key Takeaways:
- A system audit is about understanding the state of the system, not changing anything.
- Most audit commands are read-only and are safe to run.
- Documentation is as important as execution.

## What Was Confusing at First:
- The number of commands felt overwhelming.
- Some command outputs were difficult to interpret initially.
- Networking concepts required slowing down and rereading.

## What Became Clear:
- Each command answers a specific question about the system.
- Verification focuses on observations, not raw output.
- Writing things down improves confidence and recall.

## Skills Strengthened:
- Navigating the Linux filesystem.
- Reading command output carefully.
- Separating commands from explanations.
- Structuring technical documentation.

## What I Would Improve Next:
- Automate parts of the audit with scripts.
- Learn how logs relate to system auditing.
- Deepen understanding of networking diagnostics.
