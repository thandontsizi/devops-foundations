# System Setup & Network Audit Project:
## Overview:
This project documents a basic system audit performed on a Linux system.This project is part of the DevOps/Cloud Engineering Foundations learning path and combines Linux fundamentals, basic Git usage, and introductory networking concepts.
It is a foundational audit to build familiarity with how a Linux system is structured and how to verify its state using command-line tools.

The goal is to collect, document, and verify essential system information in a clear and repeatable way.

## Objectives:
- Understand the current state of a Linux system.
- Practice using common Linux audit commands.
- Document findings clearly for future reference.
- Build confidence explaining system-level checks.

## Project Structure:
- README.md: Project overview and objectives.
- commands.md: Commands used during the audit with explanations.
- verification.md: Observations and results from running commands.
- lessons-learned.md: Reflections and key takeaways.

## Scope of the Audit:
The audit covers the following areas:

- System and OS information.
- Logged in user and user identity.
- Disk usage and filesystem layout.
- Running processes and services.
- Basic networking configuration and connectivity.
- Package update status.

## How to Use This Project:
1. Review the commands in commands.md.
2. Run each command on a Linux system.
3. Record findings in verification.md.
4. Reflect on understanding in lessons-learned.md.

## Tools Used:
- Native Linux command-line utilities.
- Git for documentation and version control.

## Why this project exists:
This project combines foundational knowledge from:

- Linux Basics.
- Git Fundamentals.
- Networking Fundamentals.

The purpose is to move from isolated commands to a real, repeatable system inspection workflow that can be explained and defended.

## Environment:
- Operating System: Linux
- Access Method: Terminal (WSL)
