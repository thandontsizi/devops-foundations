## Section 1: Basic Navigation:
1. Without using 'cd', how do you confirm your current directory?

4. How do you return to your home directory from anywhere?
5. How do you move up exactly one directory level?

## Section 2: Files and Directories:
1. Create a directory called 'projects' and inside it create 'linux'.
2. Create a file titled 'notes.txt' without opening an editor.
3. Copy 'notes.txt' into another directory in one command.
4. Rename 'notes.txt' to 'linux-notes.txt'.
5. Delete a directory that contains files inside it.

## Section 3: Viewing Files.
1. View the contents of a file without editing it.
2. View a file page-by-page.
3. Show only the first 10 lines of a file.
4. Show only the last 10 lines of a file.
5. Explain when you would use 'less' instead of 'cat'.

## Section 4: Permissions.
1. What does 'rwxr-xr--' mean?
2. Change the file so that the only the owner can read and write it.
3. Add execute permission to a script file.
4. Remove write permission for group and others.
5. Why is 'chmod 777' considered dangerous?

## Section 5: Redirection and Pipes.
1. What is the difference between '>' and '>>'?
2. Redirect the output of a command into a file.
3. Append output to an existing file.
4. Pipe the output of one command into another.
5. Give an example of using '|' with 'grep'.

## Section 6: Practical Scenarios.
1. You are in the wrong directory. How do you confirm where you are and navigate to '/var/log'?
2. A file has the wrong permissions and cannot be executed. How do you fix it?
3. A directory should only be accessible by you. What permissions do you apply?
4. A command outputs too much information. How do you search within that output?
5. You need to save command output for later review. What do you do?
