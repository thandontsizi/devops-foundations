# Linux System Setup Project:

## Overview:
This project documents the initial setup and configuration of a Linux environment using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
It focuses on demonstrating and building foundational Linux skills relevant to DevOps and Cloud Engineering, including system navigation, package management, and basic tooling.


## Objectives:
- Set up a functional Linux development environment.
- Practice essential Linux terminal commands.
- Understand how system configuration works in practice.
- Document commands, verification steps, and lessons learned in the process.


## Environment:
- Host OS: Windows 11
- Linux Distribution: Ubuntu (WSL)
- Shell: Bash


## What Was Set Up:
- Linux filesystem navigation and permissions.
- Basic system utilities and packages.
- Project directory structure.
- Git-ready environment for future projects.


## Project Structure:
- README.md: Project overview and documentation.
- commands.md: All Linux commands used during system setup.
- verification.md: Steps used to confirm successful setup.
- lessons-learned.md: Reflections and key takeaways.


## How to Reproduce This Setup:
1. Set up Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)/
2. Follow the commands listed in 'commands.md'.
3. Verify each step using the checks in 'verification.md'.


## Verification:
Successful setup is confirmed by:
- Navigating the Linux filesystem without errors.
- Running basic system commands successfully.
- Confirming expected outputs for installed tools.


## Key Learnings:
- Linux systems reward precision and clarity.
- Documentation is as important as execution.
- Small setup decisions affect future scalability.


## Next Improvements:
- Expand system configuration depth.
- Add automation scripts.
- Integrate this setup into future DevOps projects.
